Certainly! Practicing with exercises is a great way to thoroughly understand the Composite Pattern. Here are some exercises that range from basic to more 
complex scenarios. These exercises are designed to be applicable across various programming languages, though they are particularly common in object-oriented 
languages like JavaScript, Java, or C#.

### Exercise 1: File System Hierarchy

**Task**: Create a file system representation using the Composite Pattern. Your system should include files and folders (directories). Folders can contain other 
folders and files.

**Key Concepts**:
- A 'File' and a 'Folder' are your leaf and composite objects, respectively.
- Both should have common operations like `getName()`, `getSize()`, and a method to display their details.

### Exercise 2: Product Catalog

**Task**: Design a product catalog where products are grouped into categories. Categories can also contain subcategories. Each product and category should have a 
method to display their details.

**Key Concepts**:
- Use 'Product' as a leaf and 'Category' as a composite.
- Implement methods to add/remove products in a category and to display the catalog.

### Exercise 3: Graphical Shapes Drawing

**Task**: Implement a system for drawing graphics where a graphic can be a simple shape (like a circle, square) or a group of shapes. Each shape or group should be 
able to `draw()` itself.

**Key Concepts**:
- Simple shapes are leaves, while a group of shapes acts as a composite.
- The composite should be able to add/remove shapes and invoke the `draw()` method on all its children.

### Exercise 4: Organizational Structure

**Task**: Build an organization chart. An organization has employees and departments. Departments can have sub-departments and employees. Implement functionality 
to display the structure and to compute total salaries in a department.

**Key Concepts**:
- Departments are composites, and employees are leaves.
- Include methods to add/remove employees and sub-departments.

### Exercise 5: Menu System for a Restaurant

**Task**: Design a menu system for a restaurant where a menu can consist of items and sub-menus. Each item and menu should have a method to display its contents.

**Key Concepts**:
- Menus are composites and items are leaves.
- Include methods to add/remove items and sub-menus.

### Exercise 6: ToDo List Application

**Task**: Create a ToDo List application where a list can contain tasks and sub-lists. Each task and list should be able to mark itself as complete and display 
its status.

**Key Concepts**:
- Lists are composites, and tasks are leaves.
- Implement functionality to mark tasks as complete and to add/remove tasks and sub-lists.

### Exercise 7: HTML DOM Representation

**Task**: Simulate a simplified HTML DOM structure where an element can be a single HTML tag or a composite of tags. Implement functionality to render the HTML structure as a string.

**Key Concepts**:
- Tags like `div`, `span` are composites; others like `img`, `input` are leaves.
- Implement a method to render the entire HTML structure from a root element.

Each of these exercises provides a practical scenario where the Composite Pattern is applicable. Start with the basic ones to grasp the core concept and then move 
to more complex ones to deepen your understanding. Remember, the key idea is to manipulate both composite and leaf objects uniformly.
