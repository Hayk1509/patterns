The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides an object acting as a substitute or placeholder for another object to control access to it. 
This pattern is widely used to control the interaction with an object, add additional functionalities, or delay the costly initialization of an object until 
it's needed. Here are some exercises to help you understand and implement the Proxy Pattern:

### Exercise 1: Image Loading Proxy

**Task**: Create a proxy for image loading. The proxy should delay the loading of a high-resolution image until it's actually needed, for instance, when an 
`displayImage` method is called.

**Key Concepts**:
- Implement a `RealImage` class that loads the actual image.
- The `ProxyImage` class should hold a reference to `RealImage` but delay its loading.
- On calling `displayImage`, the `ProxyImage` should load the `RealImage` if it's not already loaded.

### Exercise 2: Access Control for a Secure System

**Task**: Implement a proxy to control access to a secure system. The proxy should allow only authorized users to access certain methods of the system.

**Key Concepts**:
- The `SecureSystem` class contains sensitive methods.
- The `ProxySystem` class checks user credentials before allowing access to the `SecureSystem`'s methods.
- Use the proxy to intercept the method calls and perform authentication.

### Exercise 3: Logging Access to a Service

**Task**: Create a logging proxy for a service. The proxy should log each method call, its arguments, and the time of access before delegating the call to 
the service.

**Key Concepts**:
- Implement a `Service` class with some methods.
- The `LoggingProxy` class should wrap the `Service` and add logging behavior to its methods.

### Exercise 4: Virtual Proxy for Lazy Initialization

**Task**: Implement a virtual proxy for lazy initialization of an object. The proxy should create the object only when its functionality is actually required.

**Key Concepts**:
- Have a `ResourceIntensiveObject` class with resource-intensive operations.
- The `VirtualProxy` class holds a reference to `ResourceIntensiveObject` but initializes it only when its methods are called for the first time.

### Exercise 5: Network Connection Proxy

**Task**: Create a proxy that controls access to a network resource, potentially adding caching or throttling functionalities.

**Key Concepts**:
- The `NetworkResource` class simulates interaction with a network.
- The `NetworkProxy` class adds additional control, like caching results of requests or limiting the rate of requests.

### Exercise 6: Database Access Proxy

**Task**: Design a proxy to a database connection that logs queries, measures query execution time, or controls the number of active database connections.

**Key Concepts**:
- A `DatabaseConnection` class handles actual database queries.
- The `DatabaseProxy` class wraps `DatabaseConnection` to add logging, performance measurement, or connection pooling.

### Exercise 7: Property Access Proxy

**Task**: Implement a proxy to control access to properties of an object, adding validation or type checking.

**Key Concepts**:
- Have a `DataObject` class representing a data structure.
- The `DataProxy` class wraps `DataObject` and validates any changes to its properties or provides read-only access.

Each of these exercises allows you to practice different aspects of the Proxy Pattern. Start with simpler tasks like the image loader or the logging proxy to 
get a feel for the basic principles. Then, move on to more complex ones involving access control or lazy initialization. Remember, the Proxy Pattern is about 
controlling and managing access to another object, and these exercises are designed to give you hands-on experience with this concept.
